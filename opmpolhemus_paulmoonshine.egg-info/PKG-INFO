Description: # opmpolhemus
        
        This package computes the three dimensional spatial location for the center of
        the sensor cell for all OPMs whose positions are measured by a polhemus device.
        This is a necessary step in solving the *forward problem*.
        
        ## Test
        
        test by running 
        
        `python -m unittest test.test` 
        
        from the root of this project
        folder, or run it as a module: 
        
        `python -m opmpolhemus.coreg test/test_files/test01.txt`
        
        ## Usage
        
        To use this in your project, install with
        
        `python setup.py install`
        
        Then import as:
        
        `from opmpolhemus.coreg import coreg`
        
        The module does require: `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib`.
        
        The function `coreg` accepts two required arguments: `coreg(data,
        frame_style)`. The data should for now be a text file containing your
        measurements in matrix form. The frame_style should be either `top` or `base`
        (see below for more info on that).
        
        ## Hardware
        
        The OPM device is the 
        *[QZFM Gen-2](https://quspin.com/products-qzfm/)* produced by QuSpin. The
        dimensions that are listed
        [here](http://quspin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Gen-2.jpg) enter the code in
        [`constants.py`](https://github.com/paulmoonshine/opmpolhemus/blob/master/opmpolhemus/constants.py).
        
        For digitizing the points from which we compute the cell's locations, we
        use [this
        device](https://polhemus.com/scanning-digitizing/digitizing-products/).
        
        Currently, [this](https://quspin.com/experimental-meg-cap/) cap is used. To
        digitize the location of the sensor, we tap specific points on or around the OPM. Currently, we accommodate two sets of
        specific points to tap, from which this program then computes the location of
        the sensor. Such a set of specific points will be called a *frame*, and the
        frames we allow for are dubbed: *base* and *top*, and are defined as follows:
        
        ## frame: base
        ```
                <-------+  16.6 +------->
        
                         OxxxxxO

          +    O|                       |O
               xx                       xx
         12.4  xx         z=1.5         xx
               xx                       xx
          +    O|                       |O
          |     |                       |
          v     +---------xxxxx---------+
                         OxxxxxO
        ```
        *frame=base. Dimensions are in millimeters.*
        
        In this diagram, an `x` marks the location of the holder arms that are to
        encapsulate the OPM 
        ([see here](https://quspin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Holder-with-base-280x300.png)).
        These arms extend outward in direction normal to the screen.
        The rectangle drawn by the `-` lines and the `+` on the corners is the base
        frame that sits close to the scalp and is the resting frame of the OPM. Finally,
        the eight `O` points are the reference points that we mark with the polhemus.
        With these measured points (`N = 8 x # of OPMS` in total for frame=top) as input in the form of an
        `[N,3]` array, the location of the sensor within the OPM is computed for every
        OPM. Because of the thickness of the base frame, the reference points *O* sit
        slightly higher (`1.5mm`) than the OPM bottom, as noted in the diagram.
        
        ## frame: top
        ```
                <-------+  16.6 +------->
        
                           xxxxx
           ^     +---------xxxxx---------+
           |     |O                     O|
           +     |                       |
                xx                       xx
          12.4  xx         z=24.0        xx
                xx                       xx
           +     |                       |
           |     |O                     O|
           v     +---------xxxxx---------+
                           xxxxx
        ```
        *frame=top. Dimensions in millimeters.*
        
        For this frame style, we mark only the four top corners of the OPM, at the top
        face of the OPM at `z=24mm`. These are four points, obviously. As there is not
        real firm fixed base the polhemus style can rest on for this method, we advise
        to do this measurement twice, that is, to go clock-wise and perform a total of
        `8` measurements, tapping every corner twice. The program will recognize this
        and average over very nearby points (also for the case of accidental
        double-clicks).
